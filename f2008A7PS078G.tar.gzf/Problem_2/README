	3.The list of the files in the directory are as follows:
  	   <i> driver.c
  	       This file allocates a dynamic 2-D structure for storing flyer details.
  	       and passes the pointer to input(). Upon return from input, it creates subprocess 
  	       airport. The main program waits for it to finish.
  	   
  	   <ii> implementation.c
  	        Creates the process tree of the airport process. 
  	   
  	   <iii> input.c
  	   		Reads the input file, and stores the flyer details into their respective structure.
  	   
  	   <iv> colorful.c
  	   	    finds if a given number is colorful or not.
  	   
  	   <v> palindrome.c
  	        finds if a given number is a palindrome or not.
  	   <vi> prime.c
  	        finds if a given number is a prime or not.
  	   <vii> header.h
  	         Contains the structure flyers, include directives and function declarations
  	         
  	   <viii> Makefile
  	   		  Can be used to compile the program.
  	   
  	   <ix> inp3.txt,inp4.txt,inp5.txt,inp6.txt
  	   		various input files to test the program
  	   
  	   <x> Readme
  	   	    The file thats currently being read.

	** TO COMPILE THE PROGRAM:
	** IN THE DIRECTORY TYPE make
	**	
	** TO START THE PROGRAM:
	** TYPE ./out inp.txt
	** where inp.txt is the input file containing flyer information 
	
	5.I have not been able to complete the assignment because of one indeterminate error while
	  scanning the input. If the number of entries is less than 4 the input is read correctly but
	  for input more than 4 the input fails. After getting into details it was learnt that one 
	  of the malloc was failing to create memory for the 5th strutcture onwards for 
	  storing flyer details for some unknown reason. Since the number of passengers 
	  are expected to be significantly more than 4, the issue was indispensable. 
	  After some research the and using the tool valgrind the problem was found with
	  the malloc. One of the various errors is given below:
	==9570== Invalid read of size 4
	==9570==    at 0x8048A78: airport (in /home/bhuvan/Documents/
	CS_C372_OPERATING_SYSTEMS/assignments/assignment2/new_style/out)
	==9570==by 0x804871B: main (in /home/bhuvan/Documents/CS_C372_OPERATING_SYSTEMS/
	assignments/assignment2/new_style/out)
	==9570==  Address 0x42202ec is 0 bytes after a block of size 4 alloc'd
	==9570==    at 0x402BE68: malloc (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-x86-linux.so)
	==9570==    by 0x80486A3: main (in /home/bhuvan/Documents/
	CS_C372_OPERATING_SYSTEMS/assignments/assignment2/new_style/out)

	6. If I was given more time I would have declared a one Dimensional Structure and would have 
	operated it for storing multiple entries, thus eliminating the stack smashing problem I faced.
	I was able to understand the problem and the execution flow of it. I have also included the 3 
	subprograms for finding palindrome, prime numbers and colorful numbers. The input file is 
	read correctly for upto 4 entries of flyers the different dates and time are comparison ready.
