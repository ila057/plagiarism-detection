/-----------Compilation instructions------------/

-> To compile the program, simply navigate to the folder in a terminal and type make



/-----------Execution instructions-------------/

->Place the input in a 'input.txt' file before execution.

/-----------Problems---------------------------/

-> Was able to write the code on my own, with minimal help from others. 
   This took up a lot of time, hence was unable to test the code with a complete sample input.
   All of the critical internal modules have been tested seperately, but not as a whole unit.
   make command does lead to a successful compilation, however there are issues in runtime.
